# LSTMvsGRU_Forecasting
A comparison of CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU for financial forecasting tasks. This comparison was based on the task of 1 day forecasting, which both architectures excelled on with unseen data. GRU actually outperformed LSTM, perhaps due to the simpler nature of the dataset and LSTM's extra parameters making it more prone to overfitting.
